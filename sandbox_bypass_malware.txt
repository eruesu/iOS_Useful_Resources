The afcprotocol is used for iTunes to transfer backups, images and more.
via the afcprotocol an application has write and read access to /var/mobile/Media
There are tons of pc / mac applications that have implimented libimobiledevice's afcclient, like 3utools for example.
But my point is, that in fact it would be possible to make an iOS app that has access to /var/mobile/Media.
This can be used to read your photo's and other personal information.
However such an app has never been made yet, I think it might be funny to create such an app in combination with the malware for 10.3.2
This would allow attackers to spy on non-jailbroken users without them knowing it.

For jailbreak purposes, I think this can not directly be used, but it is a step further since the /var/mobile/Media directory is alreafy higher than an applications container.
The protocol was also used in the unfinished yalu 8.4.1 jailbreak by Luca Todesco.
