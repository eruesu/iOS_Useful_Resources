To escalate to root you should be looking in process communication protocols.

The main protocols for that are

ipc
xpc
and mach_messages

xpc is highlevel (sandbox level)
ipc is lowlevel (kernel level)

Since applications are able to use these protocols and can send messages using it to other processes running on the device or the kernel,
The best way to make use of it is to find a way to use these messages maliciously so you get all the permissions to receive and send.
If you can get READ and WRITE permissions by using some bug, you basically can communicate with processes like launchd, powerd, coreduetd and inetd to try to escalate to root.
Happy pwning, because since Ian Beer has reported many vulnerabilities with them, Apple has made it very hard to exploit using the framework.
But this stays a very great way to exploit.
