Yeah I know, it might sound stupid but since an iOS binary inside an app contains the SSL certificate that it is signed with,
you can overwrite that part of your binary via your binary by overflowing a buffer.

Why would you do that? Well, I think, maybe extensive codesigning. That would be fk funny, signing for months using a free developer certificate.
